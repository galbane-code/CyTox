CyTox is a web based application that acts as an all-in-one platform for executing various scanning tools on DNA sequences by userâ€™s configuration.
In addition, our application acts as a Security and Information Event Management system while the data is the inserted DNA sequences and the scanning results.
The system is an online tool that aggregates various scanning tools of DNA and protein sequences, in order to identify toxins both for research and in terms of biosecurity and to prevent biological attacks and orders of dangerous toxins. 
The system also serves as a SIEM system and enables information security management, detection of threats and sending alerts if necessary. 
In addition, the system displays reports and summaries for monitoring.
